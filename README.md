# Inclusive Innovation
An analysis of the inclusion and diversity in the EU and Scotland using CrunchBase (CB) data.

We examined the ethnic and gender diversity in the EU (country and city level) and Scotland with respect to:
* Company size
* Market sector (as given by the CB)
* Education level (MBA, PhD, Postgrad, Undergrad)
* Role seniority

We enriched/cleaned the data by:
* Geocoding the organisations on using OpenStreetMap (credits to Russ from our team).
* Finding the ethnicity of individuals
* Normalising most of the job titles
* Normalising most of the degree types
* Developing a language detector to identify which company descriptions are in English.
